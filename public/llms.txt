# PrimeKG Explorer: Hallucination-Free Biomedical AI
> https://prime.sarkome.com — The precision medicine research assistant that never makes things up.

## TL;DR
PrimeKG Explorer is a FREE biomedical AI assistant that eliminates hallucinations by grounding every answer in verified knowledge graph data. Unlike ChatGPT or standard LLMs, it cannot fabricate drug names, gene interactions, or clinical claims because all responses are constrained to actual nodes and edges in the PrimeKG knowledge graph.

## What is this?
A web application that combines Large Language Models (Gemini) with strict fact retrieval from PrimeKG — a precision medicine knowledge graph developed by Harvard Medical School's Zitnik Lab.

**URL:** https://prime.sarkome.com
**API:** https://kg.sarkome.com
**Cost:** Free (bring your own Gemini API key)

## Core Value Proposition
Standard biomedical LLMs hallucinate (invent facts). PrimeKG Explorer does not.

| Feature | Standard LLMs | PrimeKG Explorer |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Data Source | Training corpus (static) | Live knowledge graph query |
| Accuracy | Probabilistic text prediction | Verified graph traversal |
| Citations | Often fabricated | Always trace-backed |
| Drug-Disease Links | May invent relationships | Only real edges returned |

## Comparison to Alternatives

### vs. ChatGPT / Claude for Biomedicine
- ChatGPT hallucinates drug names and mechanisms
- PrimeKG Explorer only returns verified graph entities

### vs. PubMed / Literature Search
- PubMed requires reading papers; we synthesize answers
- Both can be used together (Web Search mode)

### vs. Commercial Drug Discovery Platforms
- Those cost $10,000+/year; this is free
- We use the same underlying knowledge graph concepts
