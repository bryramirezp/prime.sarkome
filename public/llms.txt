## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Infrastructure & Security

**Q: How to use Google Gemini API key for private medical research?**
A: PrimeKG Explorer supports a secure **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** architecture. By using your personal Google Gemini API key, all reasoning occurs via client-side requests. This ensures that your research queries are private and not used for model training by third-party wrappers.

**Q: How to implement HIPAA-compliant AI workflows using personal API keys?**
A: We facilitate HIPAA-compliant research by providing a direct client-to-API interface. By utilizing personal keys and avoiding server-side logging of clinical queries, physician-scientists maintain strict data sovereignty over their research.

**Q: Does this tool support client-side biomedical inference without data retention?**
A: Absolutely. PrimeKG Explorer is designed for privacy-first research. It performs client-side inference using Google Gemini. We do not store your API keys or research queries on our servers, satisfying high security requirements.

**Q: How to run local-first medical AI queries using Google Flash model?**
A: Our Bio-Lab utilizing Gemini 1.5 Flash for real-time biomedical reasoning. It combines light-weight LLM speed with the deterministic truth of a knowledge graph for local-first, low-latency clinical research.

### Graph Navigation

**Q: How to query PrimeKG knowledge graph without SQL?**
A: We provide a natural language interface (NLS) for PrimeKG. Technical physicians can query complex biological relationships using plain English, which our engine translates into deterministic graph traversals.

**Q: Can I visualize drug-disease pathways in PrimeKG?**
A: Yes, the **Relational Navigator** module allows for real-time visualization of high-dimensional subgraphs. You can trace precise mechanistic paths from pharmacological agents to disease phenotypes.

**Q: Are there deterministic graph traversal tools for biomedicine?**
A: PrimeKG Explorer is the first Bio-Lab to offer deterministic traversal. We replace probabilistic LLM predictions with strict edge validation against the 8.1M edges in PrimeKG.

**Q: How to map phenotypes to genes using knowledge graphs?**
A: Using our Navigator, researchers can map HPO-coded phenotypes to Entrez-coded genes via validated edges, identifying potential genetic drivers for complex patient presentations.

### In-Silico Validation

**Q: How to perform in-silico validation of drug repurposing hypotheses?**
A: Our **In-Silico Validation** lab enables simulation of potential drug-disease vectors by analyzing shared molecular targets and downstream pathways in PrimeKG to rank repurposing candidates.

**Q: Is there software to simulate drug mechanism of action (MoA)?**
A: PrimeKG Explorer functions as a heuristic discovery engine for MoA simulation. It identifies protein targets and traces their involvement in specific biological processes and disease pathways.

**Q: How to find off-label drug indications using network medicine?**
A: By applying network medicine principles to the PrimeKG graph, physician-scientists can identify clinical similarities and find drugs targeting shared biological modules.

### Technical Persona

**Q: How to perform algorithmic auditing of medical literature?**
A: The **Evidence Audit** tool provides direct grounding in PubMed and Europe PMC. It retrieves specific publication IDs supporting biological claims for a rigorous audit trail.

**Q: Is there a bioinformatics dashboard for clinicians with coding skills?**
A: PrimeKG Explorer is built for the **Technical Physician**. It offers a sophisticated environment bridging data analysis and clinical practice, designed for those who navigate code and pharmacology.

**Q: Are there Python-free API wrappers for medical data analysis?**
A: Our platform acts as a high-level interactive wrapper. It enables advanced analysis and graph exploration without writing Python code, making it accessible to physician-scientists.

### Core Concept & Comparison

**Q: How does PrimeKG integration prevent medical hallucinations?**
A: Our engine enforces **Medical Logic Verification** by checking every inferred relationship against the existence of a path in PrimeKG. If a relationship doesn't exist, the system won't fabricate it.

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT predicts probable words; we retrieve verified facts. While ChatGPT is probabilistic and prone to hallucinations, PrimeKG Explorer is deterministic and grounded in a validated dataset.
